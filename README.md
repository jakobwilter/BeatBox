Music is an ever changing industry. Nowadays, musicians and artists influence a significant portion of our population, 
and oftentimes play a considerable role in an individual's life whether it be helping them get through a difficult day, 
enjoying a night out, or even to celebrate a special occasion.  Unfortunately, the music industry is extremely saturated 
by amazing talent and wonderful works of art, and then diluted with subpar artists and commercial sell-outs leaving very 
little space for young, creative, unique up and coming artists to establish themselves and gain recognition. 

The industry is in need of a talent-identifier that truly reveals the best of the best in terms of new music and unknown 
musicians.  Enter. . .  BeatBox The goal of BeatBox is to create a social environment in which producers and artists converge 
and interact in an effort to create a collaborative and competitive stage where music is pushed beyond its known limits. The 
application will hold several features, the main features are listed below.  

1. Producers upload beats, tracks or songs.  
2. Artists record over the beats and share it with the users on the platform.  
3. Commercial users can vote on and rank the best artists to record over the beat.  

With this application, Bass Boosters provides worldwide access to all users who have access to the iOS app store or Google play
store to find the hottest new trends in music through worldwide competition to be the best. This application will bring new 
talented producers and musicians to the surface.
